# Search, Navigation, and Display Options

## 1) Search visibility

Enable glossary search where your users actually need it:

- archive page,
- single entry pages (if contextual lookup is useful).

## 2) Character navigation

Initial-letter navigation is useful for larger glossaries and dictionary-style usage.

When to enable:

- many entries,
- users browse alphabetically.

When to disable:

- small curated glossary,
- topic-based discovery is primary.

## 3) Archive vs single display tuning

Typical tuning options include:

- excerpt length,
- image/title emphasis,
- component visibility.

- Validate settings on mobile and tablet layouts.
