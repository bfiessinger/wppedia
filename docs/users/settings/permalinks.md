# Permalinks and URL Behavior

## 1) Why this matters

Permalink settings determine:

- glossary archive URL,
- single term URL structure,
- long-term SEO link stability.

## 2) After changing permalink-related settings

Always flush rewrite rules:

1. Go to **Settings → Permalinks**.
2. Click **Save Changes** (without needing additional edits).

This forces WordPress to refresh routing rules.

## 3) Best practices

- Choose stable slug conventions early.
- Avoid frequent slug/base changes.
- If URLs change, configure redirects where needed.
