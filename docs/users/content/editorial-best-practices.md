# Editorial Workflow and Quality Best Practices

## 1) One concept per entry

Avoid combining multiple concepts into one glossary post. Smaller, focused entries improve search relevance and cross-link quality.

## 2) Consistent naming and tone

Define an editorial style for:

- capitalization,
- abbreviations,
- formal/informal tone,
- internal linking format.

## 3) Keep glossary content evergreen

Set a recurring review cadence (monthly/quarterly):

- update outdated terms,
- remove duplicates,
- merge overlapping entries,
- improve weak definitions.

## 4) Internal linking strategy

Link related entries to create a knowledge graph for users. This improves discoverability and session depth.

## 5) Governance suggestion

Use a lightweight workflow:

- **Author** drafts entry,
- **Reviewer** validates technical correctness,
- **Editor/Owner** approves publication.
