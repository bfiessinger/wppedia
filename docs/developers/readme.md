# WPPedia Developer Documentation

This section is intended for plugin/theme developers and agency teams that want to extend WPPedia rather than only configure it.

## Start here

1. [Architecture overview](./architecture/overview.md) – where the main systems live and how requests are rendered.
2. [Extending WPPedia](./extending/overview.md) – practical extension approaches and decision guidance.
3. [Templating](./templating/overview.md) – the most important section if you want to customize output.
