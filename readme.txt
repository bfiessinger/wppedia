### What can this Glossary plugin do for you?

#### üÖ∞Ô∏è Alphabetical Index / archive
WPPedia creates glossary archives with post indexed by their initial character.

#### ‚õìÔ∏è Automated crosslinking between glossary articles
Our Glossary plugin comes with a powerful automatic crosslinking solution that builds links to other Posts directly from your content. No need for time consuming manual internal linking. WPPedia captures all occurances of your post titles and alternative terms provided by you and replaces them with links to the matching article.

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Beautifully styled tooltips
All automatic generated links are rendered with tooltips just like it's known from pages like Wikipedia. These tooltips help your users to browse through your encyclopedia with ease. Hovering over an autogenerated link will reveal a beautiful card containing useful data giving you a brief insight what's behind the next glossary article. 

#### üîé Live updating glossary terms search
The Glossary plugin comes with an easy to use searchbar with autosuggestions. No need to submit a search form to get the expected results. Just click on a result while searching and you get redirected to the matching term.

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Support for Gutenberg and other page builders
Of course the plugin is **100%** compatible with Gutenberg and other page builders out of the box - You don't need to worry about this.

#### üç¶ Only vanilla JavaScript
Speed matters! The Glossary works completely without the use of jQuery. All frontend scripts are running on good old plain (yet modern) JavaScript.

### Template System/Structure
WPPedia template files contain the markup and template structure for the frontend of your glossary. All template files contain several actions you can use to add/move/remove parts of the WPPedia Template or even restructure it completely.

Just copy files from /plugins/wppedia/templates/x.php to /themes/yourtheme/wppedia/x.php and give it your own look.
They might also left completely untouched.

Another way to restructure WPPedia is to use it's actions and filters to modify content. More about this will be available soon in the Documentation.

### How can your website benefit from a glossary?
Your website is likely filled with blog posts, shop products, case studies and more. Everything you need to get conversions, leads, etc.
