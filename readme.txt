### What can this Glossary plugin do for you?

#### üÖ∞Ô∏è Alphabetical Index / archive
Glossary by WPPedia creates glossary archives with posts indexed by their initial character.

#### ‚õìÔ∏è Automated crosslinking between glossary articles
Our Glossary plugin comes with a powerful automatic crosslinking / auto linking engine.

Glossary by WPPedia automatically recognizes any occurances of terms associated to another glossary article on your page.  
All terms are then linked to the corresponding post and provided with a tooltip, which increases the user-friendliness of the page

Now you don't need to take the time consuming effort of manually adding internal links all over your glossary term's content.

The free Version of WPPedia allows you to add up to 3 seperate alternative post terms for each glossary term. So if you have a glossary term about Elon Musk and you want this post to be linked if you type E. Musk in another article this feature is the right for your needs.

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Beautifully styled tooltips
All automatic generated links are rendered with tooltips just like it's known from pages like Wikipedia. These tooltips help your users to browse through your encyclopedia in a very efficient way. Hovering over an autogenerated link will reveal a beautiful card containing useful data giving you a brief insight what's behind the next glossary article. By the way: Glossary by WPPedia free offers you 4 different tooltip styles in the free version.

So you may ask, when Glossary by WPPedia renders the tooltips with their regarding excerpts on every post, isn't it possible that Google recognizes this as duplicate content?
No! The tooltips content is not visible to search engines on page load. It get's fetched asynchronous only when hovering an automatic generated link. 

Sounds great? It is!

#### üîé Autosuggest search for glossary terms
The Glossary plugin comes with an easy to use searchbar with autosuggestions. No need to submit a search form to get the expected results. Just click on a result while searching and you will get redirected to the matching term.

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Support for Gutenberg and other page builders

### What is a glossary?
A glossary, often called encyclopedia or wiki is an industry-specific word list with the corresponding explanations. 
It's very important that the terms defined are easy to understand and comprehensible.

### How can your website benefit from a glossary?
Your website is likely filled with blog posts, shop products, case studies and more. Everything you need to get conversions, leads, etc.

Providing a glossary on your website on the other hand is an ideal way to pass expert knowledge about a specific topic.  
It is a win-win situation for everyone involved: The user finds everything in one place and does not have to pull information "externally", you, the website owner, keep your visitors on your page. 
These visitors are then more likely to convert into customers.

However, by providing educational and informational quality content you can significantly improve your website‚Äôs SEO and ranking on search engines like Google, Bing, etc.
