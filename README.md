> Be your own WikiPedia!

## What can WPPedia do for you?

### Automated crosslinking
WPPedia comes with a powerful automatic crosslinking solution that builds links to other Posts directly from your content. No need for time consuming manual internal linking.

### Beautifully styled tooltips
All automatic generated links are rendered with tooltips just like it's known from pages like Wikipedia.

### Live updating glossary terms search
WPPedia comes with an easy to use searchbar with autosuggestions. No need to submit a search form to get the expected results. Just click on a result while searching and you get redirected to the matching term.

### Support for Gutenberg and other page builders
Of course the plugin is 100% compatible with Gutenberg and other page builders out of the box - You don't need to worry about this.

### Only vanilla JavaScript
Speed matters! WPPedia works completely without the use of jQuery. All scripts are running on good old plain (yet modern) JavaScript.

### Need more?
We are constantly updating this plugin to offer as many features as possible.

## Template System/Structure
WPPedia template files contain the markup and template structure for the frontend of your glossary. All template files contain several actions you can use to add/move/remove parts of the WPPedia Template or even restructure it completely.

Just copy files from /plugins/wppedia/templates/x.php to /themes/yourtheme/wppedia/x.php and give it your own look.
They might also left completely untouched.

Another way to restructure WPPedia is to use it's actions and filters to modify content. More about this will be available soon in the Documentation.
