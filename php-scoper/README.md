# [PHP Scoper](https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper)

> PHP-Scoper is a tool which essentially moves any body of code, including all dependencies such as vendor directories, to a new and distinct namespace.

PHP Scoper is used to namespace all of WPPedia's dependencies under a first party namespace to prevent conflicts with other plugins and themes.
